# cookie_craker
An automated game playing bot that plays the classic version of the cookie cracker game
I have taken two approaches to building this bot.
FIRST
This is very systematic approach where we find the ids of all the affordable upgradesand after every 5 secs and choose the costliest upgrade.
SECOND
In this approach we click on all the upgrades in reverse order 5 times each after every 5 seconds.

We do this for 5 minutes and then Check the cookies per second.
